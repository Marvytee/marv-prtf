                <p>My name is Aliyu Marvelous Temitope, my friends call me "Marvytee" which is gotten from combining the first few letters of my firstname and middlename.</p>
                <p>My interest in web development began when I saw my sister's friend solve problems. This opened my eyes to world problems and also exposed me to my ability to solve them.</p>
                <p>Apart from this, my inquistiveness got the best of me as I soon found myself trying to get information about what web development was.</p>
                <p>I was also blessed with a loving community which is Stutern that was able to fuel my passion for web development.</p>
